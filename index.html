    <h3>The Project:</h3>
    <p>Create a plan/policy to detect passing three doors by adapting the code from Project 1 ro an iRobot Create 3.</p>
    
    <h3>Baysian Network</h3>
    <img src="Model_50.png?raw=true" alt="Final trained network" width="1280" height="480">
    <p>We used the python library Pomegranate to build and fit our Bayesian network from gathered data. 
      The data we gathered was of the robot heading toward the door with the wall on its left. 
      The network at school proved a challenge when connecting to the robot via ROS.
      We ended up having to take the robot home and improvised doors to use for training.

		  <li>
            create3_ws/ - This is a workspace for the Create robot simulator. We used this a few times when developing the code
          </li>
		  <li>
			Dockerfile - This is a Dockerfile to use when generating the bayesian network.
		  </li>	
          <li>
            door_data/ - This is all of our collected data from the robot that we gathered during training.

		  <li>
			instructions.txt - Basic instructions used when generating the data.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			pomdp/ - Contains an example run of the POMDP Python code we made with pictures showing the different states and how the probability of the POMDP moved over time. The data.txt file contains the data from the execution of the POMDP and shows the hardcoded observations we provided. The PODMP CPT tables were based on hardcoded values as well.
		  </li>
		  <li>
			python/ - Contains the source code for generating the distance from the wall as a probability distribution (dist_from_wall.py), the input santitation that distance from wall script uses (ir_intensity.sh) and the trained bayesian network and live_model.py used for live testing. Also contains the ROS API commands for rotating and wall following contained in ros.py and the POMDP Python code contained in pomDP.py.
          <li>
            ros2_ws/ - This is a workspace that has the specialized irobot_create_msgs which are customized actions, topics, and messages that the robot uses to communicate in ROS.
          </li>
          <li>
            ros_ign/ - This is a workspace that contains code for linking ROS to Gazebo. This is used by the simulator code.
          </li>
          <li>
            workspace/ - This is a workspace containing Gazebo support code. This is used by the simulator code.

            <p>
                If you want to take measurements using the code you have to download all the workspaces and then source the setup files.
                As well as have ROS2 downloaded. Refer to the README in the "create3_examples_ws" folder.
