    <h3>The Project:</h3>
    <p>Creating an implementation of a Bayesian network for recess detection using the sensor model of an iRobot Create 3. Then determine the robot's actual distance from the wall as well as when it is 10 cm past a door.</p>
    
    <h3>Baysian Network</h3>
    <img src="" alt="Final trained network">
    <p>We used the python library Pomegranate to build and fit our Bayesian network from gathered data. 
        The data we gathered was of the robot heading toward the door with the wall on its left. 
        The network at school proved a challenge when connecting to the robot via ROS.
        We ended up having to take the robot home and improvise a door to use for training.

            <p>
                If you want to take measurements using the code you have to download all the workspaces and then source the setup files.
                As well as have ROS2 downloaded.

            This program uses ir_intensity.sh to extract ir_intensity values from the test data to plot the actual distance from the wall as a probability distribution. 
            The distribution is generated by comparing each ir_intensity group of values to their respective ir_intensity distributions that we gathered by hand. 
            We took measurements at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3 inches, and got probability distributions of each IR sensor at each measurement.
            Given an IR value for each IR sensor in test, we aggregate the probability of each IR sensor's expected distance from these probability distributions.
