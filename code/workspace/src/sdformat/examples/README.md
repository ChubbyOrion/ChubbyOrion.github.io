## Simple Example

This example compiles and runs the code in `simple.cc`. The `simple` program is
a basic example of parsing an SDF file and accessing the resulting data.

1. Compile

    ```
    mkdir build; cd build
    ```

    ```
    cmake ../; make
    ```

1. Run

    ```
    ./simple ../simple.sdf
    ```
